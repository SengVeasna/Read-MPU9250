## 1. Introduction
#### What's the sensor?
#### The sensor is the devide that convert from physical signal to electrical signal.

### How to set-up SICK DT-35?
* Select Q1 near and Q2 near then set the distance that nearly from the sensor to the point that we wanted.
* select Q1 far and Q2 far then set the distance that farly from the sensor to the point that we wanted.
* After we set-up aready. We would like to find the linear equation from the real-distance calibration with the data adc that read from the sensor.
